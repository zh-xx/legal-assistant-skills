# Consolidated Review Opinion

Based on the contract summary and audit findings, draft a concise response to the business team. The output must contain **two natural paragraphs** and must follow the contract’s language. See **[language.md](language.md)**.

Default output file name: `综合审核意见.docx` for Chinese or `Consolidated_Opinion.docx` for English.

## Paragraph 1: Contract Core Overview

Write one coherent paragraph summarizing the contract’s core content:
- Contract nature (e.g., “a three‑year equipment procurement framework agreement”)
- Core business model (what is traded, total amount, payment schedule)
- Key timing milestones

**Referencing rules**:
- Use “our side” / “counterparty” or specific company names
- Avoid “Party A / Party B” labels

## Paragraph 2: Major Risks

Write one paragraph that lists the key risks discovered **only** from audit findings:
- Start with a summary sentence, e.g., “After review, the following key risks require attention:”
- Use numbered items (1. 2. 3.)
- Each item must describe: risk type, concrete issue, potential impact, and attention level
- Do not introduce new risks not in the audit findings

## Output Requirements

- Two paragraphs only; no section headings
- Numbered items should be **separate paragraphs** in rich text output
- Language concise, professional, objective
